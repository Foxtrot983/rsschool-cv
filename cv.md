# About me:
My objective is to find a convinient place in my life and i want to change my occupation because tired of being a teacher. Have a little experience in working as backend python developer on freelance but i haven't enough of knowledge to work with a hard tasks, so i quit that job and continued to work on myself. I think my strengths in that i am working hard and also i respect others time and my time.
